# Using XGBoost to Predict Student's Grade Based on Their Performance and Behaviour 🧑‍🎓

This prediction used XGBoost Classifier model with the combination of one hot encoding, label encoding, and standard scaling in order to achieve maximal results. Columns with irrelevant information, such as email, student ID, first name, and last name are removed in order to remove irrelevant noise in model training process. It has high accuracy (> 0.90) but the predicton for Grade 'A' has lower precision, recall, and f1-score compared to the prediction for another grade due to the lack of data for the Grade A itself.
